This repository contains the Arduino Mega code for the S&T GeoTronics M4 Enigma.
The S&T GeoTronics M4 Enigma is an Arduino custom shield programmed to replicate the behavior of a German M4 Enigma machine.
It consistes of 4 16-Segment units, 5 LEDs, 26 Lamps setup as keyboard, 26 keyboard buttons & 10 Function keys. The 115 light emitting diodes are multi-plexed. This minimizes the amount of pins needed to control them down to 38 pins and all 36 pushbuttons keys are sharing a total of 4 pins.

Designed, assembled & programmed by Marc Tessier & James Sanderson 9/20/13
   Modified for our Prototype PCB pair on 12/4/13.
   Modified to obey doublesteping and have M3 function 22 MAR 14
